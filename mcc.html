  <h1>Things you need to know if you're joining the club:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>We meet 5 pm after school on a document called MCC. This document was made with Google Docs.</li>
    <li>This is a group of kids, not adults, and we would like to keep it this way.</li>
    <li>We all study different creatures at different times. So if someone's already doing one that you want, pick another and wait.</li>
